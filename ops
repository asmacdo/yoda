The major ongoing discussions cluster into these themes:                                                                                                                                             \n\n  1. Naming \u0026 Framing (largely resolved)\n\n  The acronym evolved from YODA → VAMP → STAMP(ED). Issues #7 (VAMP rename) and #15 (Nature Methods target) are closed. The current working acronym is STAMPED, with branches stamped-rewrite and propose-stamped-acronym in flight. Issues #2\n   (title clarity) and #16 (clear definition) remain open but will resolve once the STAMPED rewrite lands.\n\n  2. Conceptual Pillars — Active Debate\n\n  Three new-concept issues represent the most substantive discussions:\n  - #31 — Actionability is cross-sectional: Consensus that actionability cuts across all pillars (not just provenance). Debated \"Actionable\" vs \"Automated\" vs \"Automatable\" — settled on keeping \"Actionable.\"\n  - #29 — Compute ephemerality: \"Destroy the environment after running\" as a SHOULD-level principle. Discussion about not overwhelming average scientists — perhaps a gold-standard tier.\n  - #27 — Self-containment scope: What MUST vs MAY be included. Ongoing confusion about MUST/SHOULD/MAY strength terminology that needs resolving.\n  - #38 — Distribution: Distribution as both the ultimate ideal and paradoxically the first step. Needs explicit definition beyond \"drop files on Zenodo.\"\n\n  3. Content Gaps — Concrete TODOs\n\n  - #3, #4, #5, #6 — Compliant/non-compliant examples for each pillar (P1–P4). None have examples yet.\n  - #8 — Methods section is empty.\n  - #10 — Compliance checklist — tangible takeaway for readers.\n  - #18 — Core term definitions (research object, component, asset, actionability).\n  - #32 — FAIR reference — how STAMPED relates to FAIR. A comparison table suggested.\n  - #22 — Figures/tables brainstorming needed.\n  - #1 — \"Don't look up\" principle needs formalization.\n  - #34 — Portability limitations — what can vs can't be portable.\n\n  4. Infrastructure \u0026 Process\n\n  - #11 — Austin's all-clear: Sprint planned for week of 2/16 (this week!) to produce stable draft for team review.\n  - #30 — CI to push to Overleaf: Unexplored.\n  - #19 — Zenodo DOI: Waiting on release.\n  - #20 — Examples repo: Started at asmacdo/simple-yoda-project, needs expanding.\n  - #23 — Automated outline updater: Would catch structural violations.\n  - #35 — Update con/serve: Should be raised on that repo instead.\n  - #36 — Claude reading issues: Partially resolved by this very exercise.\n\n  ---\n  Immediate Plan\n\n  Given that Austin's sprint is this week (#11), the priority is aligning on what needs to land in the stable draft vs what comes later.\n\n  This Week — Draft Sprint Priorities\n\n  1. Land the STAMPED rewrite (stamped-rewrite / propose-stamped-acronym branches) — this resolves #2, #7, #16\n  2. Add core term definitions (#18) — needed before reviewers can evaluate the draft\n  3. Formalize \"Don't look up\" (#1) — it's the distinguishing YODA/STAMPED principle and currently informal\n  4. Add the STAMPED summary table (#13 was closed but the table should exist in the STAMPED framing)\n  5. Write the FAIR comparison paragraph (#32) — reviewers will ask \"why not just FAIR?\"\n  6. Resolve MUST/SHOULD/MAY confusion (#27 discussion) — the RFC 2119 terminology must be consistent\n\n  Next — Post-Sprint, Pre-Submission\n\n  7. Add compliant/non-compliant examples (#3, #4, #5, #6) — ideally one per pillar minimum\n  8. Write Methods section (#8) — can be AI-assisted once principles are stable\n  9. Create compliance checklist (#10) — strong reader takeaway\n  10. Brainstorm figures (#22) — organigram updated for STAMPED, plus real-world use case trees\n  11. Flesh out Distribution (#38) and Ephemerality (#29) — decide if they are full STAMPED letters or aspirational extensions\n\n  Deferred\n\n  12. Infrastructure: Zenodo DOI (#19), CI→Overleaf (#30), examples repo (#20), outline automation (#23)\n  13. Close stale issues: #21 (phrasing may be rewritten), #35 (belongs on con/serve), #36 (partially resolved)\n\n  ---\n  Want me to start working on any of these items, or should we wait for the sprint draft to land first?\n\n\u003c/details\u003e\n\nso seems to be doing pretty fine in accessing issues from git-bug","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f00b071b1954af5dec4d463e8167798000a9677"},"timestamp":1771382059,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7pimZG","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/36#issuecomment-3918161478"},"message":"\u003e so seems to be doing pretty fine in accessing issues from git-bug\n\nThe questions were\n\n(i) how does that output compare to direct prompt to scan and summarize the same info without git-bug (using gh api) and\n\n(ii) does it look deep into the discussion of PR comments, where most of the line-by-line details are flushed out?\n\nCan definitely close many issues once #39 is closed, possibly some now already","files":null},{"type":6,"author":{"id":"4f00b071b1954af5dec4d463e8167798000a9677"},"timestamp":1771382073,"metadata":{"github-id":"UCE_lALORKQ0ks7pimZGzpnTET8"},"target":"181c7f36186701459112743c57fb9750f04ae4350953e1d2ee9bb4d5a5db7120","message":"\u003e so seems to be doing pretty fine in accessing issues from git-bug\n\nThe questions were\n\n(i) how does that output compare to direct prompt to scan and summarize the same info without git-bug (using gh api)\n\nand\n\n(ii) does it look deep into the discussion of PR comments, where most of the line-by-line details are flushed out?\n\nCan definitely close many issues once #39 is closed, possibly some now already","files":null}]}
