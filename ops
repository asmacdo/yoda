It could even be described semi-officially as the \"Don't look up\" principle\n\nHowever, it is not on its own self-descriptive enough to convey the meaning (especially to a first-time learner of the principles) without providing additional context\n\nWhatever and wherever the official principle finally ends up as, it should formally and clearly describe what is meant and give both examples and counter examples","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"235d4a8e78663c23721b40a6b9129ae1c6805b76"},"timestamp":1770592548,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7mlTpv","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/1#issuecomment-3868539503"},"message":"Added P0 about self containment.\n\n\"Don't look up\" kind of refers to more than one principle, but this one most of all, and the other principles get into more detail.
