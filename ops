In this case, the \"cannot be portable\" parts are config files local to the environment, and templated bash scripts/ sbatch files that use local variables.\n\nMy initial thinking is that \"code\" should be portable, while \"config\" may be specific to a local environment. But templated code blurs the line. \n\nThe solution we leaned towards was:\n\n```\ncode/\n   //fully-portable-code-repo/  # just a composed clone\n   local/                       # not a subdataset\n      my-specific-config.yaml     \n      my-templated-code.sbatch\n      my-example-config.yaml    # Optional but nice to have\n      README                    # how to use/generate local files\n```\nNote that it might not even be possible to commit/share my-specific-config.yaml (ie might contain secrets), \n\nThere are other limiting factors to portability also, so we need to clarify to what degree portability is required. I'm thinking something like:\n  - configuration steps MUST documented\n  - actual local configuration MAY (or should?) be included\n  - system requirements: ie, this may be portable to some setups but not necessarily ANY setup","files":null}]}
