Kinda emphasizes on how the scientist takes active control of the data analysis project by following this set of best practices. \n\nI also like Yoda's Organogram for Data Analysis because it's self-containing and recursive which is kind of the tricky/key part. And it sticks and makes you wonder why. Plus, phonetics matter? :D My two cents here.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f00b071b1954af5dec4d463e8167798000a9677"},"timestamp":1771364920,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7pfIJy","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/7#issuecomment-3917251186"},"message":"STAMPED is the current working acronym (#33), for many of the same reasons highlighted above (the column that is all green, instead of mostly red - how very un-Yoda-like tsk tsk)\n\nForgot to close this\n\n\n\n\u003e An alternative for YODA: Your Own Data Analysis.\n\nThank you, I do very much like that version more and would recommend the DataLad version of YODA swap to that - which will continue to exist as a 'recursor' of sorts.
