Issues are stored as git objects under `refs/bugs/` (doesnt pollute history, totally separate from the working tree). \n\nBut for AI context, it's just swapping `gh issue view` for `git bug show`. Generally in my workflow I pass it an issue/pr link, and ask it to fetch other linked context sources, and this is usually sufficient and doesn't take too long. git-bug could be a lot faster, but it doesnt solve the problem of knowing what to look for. \n\nBoth git-bug and gh over API support full-text search, so if we had a clever command/skill/CLAUDE.md to gather related context, it might be helpful whether or not we keep the files locally. The key weakness is that it depends on the agent using the \"correct\" keywords. IMO we could try this out using the current vanilla gh API, and if it works well enough to be useful we can speed it up with git-bug.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"4f00b071b1954af5dec4d463e8167798000a9677"},"timestamp":1771349678,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7paprW","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/36#issuecomment-3916077782"},"message":"Sounds good, fine with trying out w/e works easiest for now","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"235d4a8e78663c23721b40a6b9129ae1c6805b76"},"timestamp":1771359538,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7pduAj","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/36#issuecomment-3916881955"},"message":"Well I tried it out, and I experimented a bit but I dont think this is actually useful.
