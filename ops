This doesn't mean all bytes must be stored inline, but that all dependencies are tracked and mirrorable.\n\n## MUST be contained\n- Raw and derived datasets\n- Analysis code and scripts\n- Built environment artifacts (e.g., container images)\n- Configuration and parameter files\n- Provenance records\n\n## MAY be contained\n- Upstream build dependencies (e.g., the `ubuntu:22.04` base image referenced by `FROM` in a Dockerfile)\n- Source packages used to build a contained derivative\n- Build toolchains\n\nThe rationale: we include **derivatives** (the built container), so the upstream sources used to produce them are not essential for reproducing results from that point forward.\n\n## The Pulp analogy\n\n[Pulp](https://pulpproject.org/) is a content management platform that mirrors entire upstream package repositories (RPM, PyPI, container registries, etc.), creating point-in-time snapshots of everything down to the base OS packages. A Pulp repo could contain all assets required to build the assets included in a repo via a pull-though cache setup. This represents the extreme end of the self-containment spectrum \"full supply chain mirroring\". While achievable and valuable in enterprise/infrastructure contexts, VAMP does not require this level of containment for research reproducibility. The line is drawn at the derivatives: if you have the built container image version-controlled in your research object, you don't also need to mirror the Ubuntu APT repository it was built from.\n\nPulp illustrates that the containment spectrum is continuous, and VAMP's MUST/MAY distinction allows a pragmatic cut point even though it is not an inherent boundary.  I don't know if Pulp belongs in the final paper, but since the project is an old friend I wanted to share how it applies.","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c896512a0e2e93b7e37e352ce3e58506d65f25f6"},"timestamp":1770736464,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7nK5u9","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/27#issuecomment-3878394813"},"message":"well -- such MAY then SHOULD be characterized: sure thing people MAY contain anything which is not an obstruction to the primary goal -- additional data types etc. But that makes it into a point that system SHOULD NOT be burdened with additional content (might be simply an issue of inodes) and thus relating to modularity as such components might need to be modularized away, so that they could be brought in only when needed.","files":null},{"type":5,"author":{"id":"c896512a0e2e93b7e37e352ce3e58506d65f25f6"},"timestamp":1770902224,"metadata":{"github-id":"LE_lADORKQ0ks7pRttzzwAAAAVLHm6U"},"added":["new-concept"],"removed":[]}]}
