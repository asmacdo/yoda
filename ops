A consolidated reference table would help readers see the full picture at a glance.\n\n## What needs to happen\n\nAdd a table (likely in Results or as a standalone subsection) listing all formal principles:\n\n| ID | Pillar | Level | Principle |\n|----|--------|-------|-----------|\n| P1.1 | Version Control | MUST | All assets essential to replicate computational execution must be included |\n| P1.2 | Version Control | SHOULD | All assets should be version controlled using the same VCS |\n| P2.1 | Modularity | SHOULD | Assets should be organized in a modular structure |\n| P2.2 | Modularity | MAY | Assets may be included directly or linked as subdatasets |\n| P2.3 | Modularity | SHOULD | Components should accommodate domain-specific standards |\n| P3.1 | Provenance | MUST | Provenance of all modifications must be annotated |\n| P3.2 | Provenance | SHOULD/MUST | Code-driven provenance should be annotated programmatically, must include versions |\n| P4.1 | Environments | MUST | Computational environments must be explicitly specified |\n| P4.2 | Environments | SHOULD | Environment specifications should be machine-reproducible |\n| P4.3 | Environments | MUST | Environment definitions must be version controlled |\n| P4.4 | Environments | SHOULD | Environments should be self-contained within the dataset |\n\nNote: If #1 (P2.4/P2.5 \"Do not look up\") is merged first, include those too.","files":null}]}
