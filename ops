If less known tool -- pointing to its docs and providing overall description is IMHO sufficient.  To avoid duplication (which is evil) we could recommend pointing to documentation website with a permalink on archive.org . Raising common denominator for future reproducibility attempts, pointing to  a containerized version of a tool might also be advised.","files":null}]}
