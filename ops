But perhaps still good idea to recommend (weak) that sourcedata ought to be FAIR (as in re-analysis of open datasets)","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c896512a0e2e93b7e37e352ce3e58506d65f25f6"},"timestamp":1771269740,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7pEPjL","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/32#issuecomment-3910203595"},"message":"I can be wrong, but I think nearly nothing in YODA/STAMPED actually mandates  FAIRness of any specific component/aspect, although some are somewhat implied: only Interoperable components could be composed, we aim to facilitate Reuse, and Accessibility is in the heart as well.  Systems which implement YODA/STAMPED though might hugely facilitate various aspects of FAIR (e.g. like DataLad - nearly all aspects FAIR besides formalization of actual data formats) , but do not have to.  Hence inputs and outputs might vary in their \"FAIRness\" although aspects such as AI (accessible and interoperable) will be facilitated by a STAMPED workflow.\n\nSo, overall, YODA/STAMPED facilitate fulfilling FAIR principles but IMHO aims for different ideals, and also defines them more pragmatically as more architecturally (modular) and operationally (version-control/tracked, actionable, portable/distributable), hence aligning across those FAIR dimensions. May be there could even be a table which would align STAMPED along FAIR principles?","files":null},{"type":3,"author":{"id":"c896512a0e2e93b7e37e352ce3e58506d65f25f6"},"timestamp":1771273100,"metadata":{"github-id":"IC_kwDORKQ0ks7pE4RD","github-url":"https://github.com/myyoda/principles-paper/issues/32#issuecomment-3910370371"},"message":"Some reference to FAIR now also added in fixed up con/serve which I treat to a degree as an obnoxious \"FAIR STAMPED effort\" ;)\n \n- https://con.github.io/serve/about/#stamped-principles","files":null}]}
