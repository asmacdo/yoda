\section{Introduction}

Managing data in modern scientific research presents unprecedented challenges due to rapidly expanding dataset scale, complexity, and interdependency.
A workflow is the formal specification of data flow and execution control between components, which include executable code, configuration files, data (inputs and outputs), and provenance records.
Executing a workflow with specific inputs and parameters generates a workflow run—a complete record of the execution process documenting the method, intermediate steps, and outputs.
Currently, however, workflow components—data, code, provenance, and computational environments—are frequently managed separately; this separation introduces complexity and undermines reproducibility, transparency, and rigor.
While version control is a standard practice for code and containers, data versioning and integrated provenance tracking remain frequently overlooked.

The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and FAIR4RS guidelines for research software provide structured guidance to ensure that digital objects are managed in ways that support reuse and reproducibility.
The Workflow Community Initiative’s FAIR Workflows Working Group (WCI-FW) explicitly chose not to define new principles specifically tailored for workflows.
Instead, recognizing workflows as hybrid objects that share characteristics of both data and software, they focus on applying established FAIR guidelines directly.

Several terms central to this work---research object, component, module, workflow, provenance---are used across many domains with varying meanings. We define our usage as follows:
A \textbf{research object} is a collection of data, code, and metadata that together represent a complete unit of research output.
A research object is composed of \textbf{modules}---separately distributable collections of components (e.g., an input dataset, a container image, an analysis pipeline).
A \textbf{component} is a trackable element that is part of a module (e.g., a data file, a script, a configuration file, a metadata file); a module contains components, but not every component is itself a module.
A \textbf{workflow} is a sequence of computational steps that transform data within the research object using code components to produce output data.
\textbf{Provenance} is the recorded history of how components were produced or modified, including what actions were performed, what inputs were used, and the versions of everything involved.

Building on this foundation, we present the STAMPED properties (Self-contained, Tracked, Actionable, Modular, Portable, Ephemeral, and Distributable) which characterize a well-formed reproducible research object.
Originating from the YODA Principles, STAMPED provides a framework for evaluating and improving the reproducibility of research objects.
Full reproducibility is an asymptotic goal;
STAMPED takes a pragmatic approach in which each property can be satisfied at varying levels of rigor, from practical minimums to aspirational ideals.
STAMPED complements formal computational workflow guidelines (e.g., FAIR4RS, RO-Crate) and facilitates the transition toward comprehensive workflow automation.


\subsection{Related Work: Organizational Principles Across Domains}

The challenges YODA addresses are not unique to neuroscience or even scientific computing broadly.
Multiple communities independently developed organizational frameworks exhibiting remarkable convergent evolution toward similar core patterns.

Between 2003 and 2025, at least 19 distinct initiatives emerged addressing research data organization, version control, and reproducibility:

% TODO: add references to all!
\textbf{Foundational principles}: Noble's 2009 guidelines for computational biology organization, FAIR principles (2016) for data sharing, Software Carpentry's ``Good Enough Practices'' (2017).

\textbf{Version control extensions}: git-annex (2010), Git LFS (2015), DVC (2017), Pachyderm (2014), Quilt (2020s) all independently arrived at ``Git for data'' concepts, applying proven version control semantics to large datasets.

\textbf{Cloud platforms}: Code Ocean (2017), brainlife.io (2017), Flywheel (2018), Galaxy (2005) provide turnkey reproducibility services, all implementing code/environment/data trinity separation.

\textbf{Framework tooling}: Kedro (2019), nipoppy (2023), Cookiecutter Data Science (2016) provide opinionated structures for data engineering and neuroimaging workflows.

% Should remove BEP028- too niche etc, but might be worth refer to the PROV itself! and potentially BIDS itself since provides poor man versioning (CHANGES) + structure + linking to SourceDatasets
\textbf{Metadata standards}: RO-Crate (2019), BioComputeObject (IEEE 2791-2020), PROV (TODO), BIDS (2016) address packaging and provenance standardization.

Despite independent origins, these frameworks converged on core patterns:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Separation of concerns}: Data, code, environment, and results managed distinctly
    \item \textbf{Immutability}: Raw data never modified in-place
    \item \textbf{Hierarchical organization}: Nested, modular structures
    \item \textbf{Version control}: Applying Git concepts beyond just code
    \item \textbf{Provenance tracking}: Recording how outputs were generated
\end{itemize}

YODA's unique contributions within this landscape:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Federated composition}: Subdatasets can live anywhere (not centralized)
    \item \textbf{Interface agnosticism}: Works with any container/pipeline system
    \item \textbf{Local-first design}: Works offline, no cloud platform dependency
    \item \textbf{git-annex flexibility}: Many remote types vs single-server models
    \item \textbf{Scale via modularity}: Proven from single files to 8000+ subdatasets (datasets.datalad.org)
\end{itemize}

This convergent evolution validates that YODA principles are not arbitrary choices but responses to fundamental challenges in computational research reproducibility.
The formalization presented here provides a foundation for interoperability and comparison across this evolving ecosystem of tools and standards.

\subsection{Self-contained}

Reproducibility fails when a research object depends on resources that are not part of it---an undocumented library, a dataset referenced by a broken URL, a script that assumes tools are installed on the host system.
We call this the ``don't look up'' rule: a research object must never rely on implicit external state.
Instead, it must be a complete retrieval unit, where all modules and components essential to reproduce its results are contained within a single top-level boundary.

Self-containment is the foundational property upon which the remaining STAMPED properties build.
Tracking, Modularity, Portability, and Distributability each address a different aspect of how that boundary is organized, versioned, and shared---but none are meaningful without first establishing what is inside it.

Components may be included literally (e.g., files committed directly) or by reference (e.g., as subdatasets, registered data URLs).
Both approaches satisfy self-containment, provided the references are explicit and tracked within the research object.
The stability and precision of those references---content hashes versus mutable URLs---is the concern of Tracking (T), and whether they remain retrievable by others over time is the concern of Distributability (D).

\subsection{Tracked}

Research data frequently exists outside the scope of established version control practices, leading to a multitude of reproducibility issues.
Non-version-controlled data creates ambiguity, as precise identification of dataset states is challenging, and historical changes are difficult to reconstruct or verify.
This ambiguity undermines trust, complicates collaboration, and impairs reproducibility, particularly when datasets undergo frequent updates or transformations.

Version control systems (VCS), such as git, directly address these issues by associating each revision with a unique identifier and recording basic provenance information, including who made the changes, when, and why.
Although commonly called ``version control systems,'' the primary value is not version numbering (``v1'' vs ``v2'') but \emph{content-addressed identification}.
Git describes itself as ``the stupid content tracker'' (from \texttt{man git}), using cryptographic checksums as content identifiers.
Explicit version tags (v1.0, v2.3) are convenience labels atop this content-tracking foundation.
This distinction matters: reproducibility requires precise content identification, not just semantic versioning.
Two datasets labeled ``version 1.0'' by different labs are ambiguous; two datasets with identical content hashes are provably identical.
Throughout the manuscript we will refer to such content tracking systems as VCS to use terminology familiar to the reader, although some initiatives such as \cite{sciops-paper} would describe such requirement as data consistency.

By applying VCS systematically to data and analysis outputs, researchers can pinpoint exact states of digital files, reliably reverting or exploring previous versions as needed.
Although traditional version control systems have limitations when managing large datasets due to storage inefficiencies, modern tools such as git-annex, DataLad, or DVC effectively extend git functionality to handle large, binary, and distributed datasets.
These tools enable researchers to manage extensive datasets without losing the benefits of traditional version control, including improved collaboration through explicit tracking of changes, efficient reversion of undesired modifications, and the ability to reconstruct past research states—effectively enabling "time travel."

Critically, approaching full reproducibility requires that version control encompasses all components essential for replicating computational workflows.
These components typically include raw and derived datasets, preprocessing and analysis scripts, parameter and configuration files, computational environment definitions (such as Docker or Singularity containers), and accompanying documentation describing workflow execution details.
Omitting even one component can severely compromise reproducibility, making comprehensive version control across these assets a fundamental necessity.

% TODO: formal principles removed — now in STAMPED table (S.1, T.1, T.2)
% TODO: strip S-redundant content (lines 155-157 overlap with S section)

Tracking encompasses not only version history but also provenance---the record of what actions produced or modified each component.
Provenance collection typically occurs separately from version control, leading to fragmentation: the data is versioned in one system while the record of how it was produced lives in another (or nowhere).
Embedding provenance directly into version control history---for example, by encoding descriptions of computational actions into commit records---unifies these concerns.
A provenance-rich commit history records not just that a file changed, but what command was executed, what inputs it consumed, and what versions of code and environment were involved.

For code-driven modifications, provenance should be captured programmatically rather than by manual annotation.
This ensures completeness and enables re-execution: a researcher can not only see what was done but repeat it.
% TODO: cite Tek Raj paper, provenance format approaches
% TODO: mention W3C PROV, RO-Crate, BEP028 as interoperable export targets
% TODO: spectrum — minimum (manual commit messages describing what was done) vs ideal (programmatic provenance capture with full dependency graphs, re-executable)
% that's where might be worth already to talk about ability of the used VCS/platform to "replicate" the outside components within it.
% e.g. if containers are used, it must provide storage for those containers as part of the resource, and not to rely on external links which might disappear.
% To a degree - VCS should provide ways to "cauterize the wound" (or find a better analogie).
% It should make it "safe to make a cut", but also to "re-connect" the component if any detail or functionality of it is needed.
% And that should lead into modularity + git modules as the way "to cauterize"

\subsection{Modularity}

% TODO: give a different flow into this. Rather accent that research project encompases multiple stages from conception, to raw data collection, analytics, ... publication.
% For reproducibility sake we need to be able to link all of them, but all of them are also useful on their own.
% So similarly to software development where we build a product, which might need compilation from sources - we provide compiled version while not shipping sources + compiler + environment along since they are not needed to use that product.
% Establishing reliable and reproducible builds important and thus done also in software distributions, e.g. see https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds .
% Another factor is that reused components, better exist in single reusable copy to ease fixing/maintenance/reduce size, so in software we e.g. have dynamic libraries.
% So, the boundaries between "modules" are pragmatically driven by establishing "sensibly useful independently module", often, most frequently - derived products adding their unique aspects on top of their "sources".
% Moreover, dealing with such different levels of data processing and modularization facilitates "handoffs" between team members (SciOps).

% Composition remains "an issue"
% Often relates to "provenance"
% **Introduce existing compositional patterns (references/urls), frictionless data, BIDS (bids uri, SourceDatasets, code/), other approaches to describe; Actionability: PROV **
% Introduce YODA (and VAMP) as attempt to formalize principles on HOW components should be organized using version control system

Monolithic structures present significant barriers to effective development, maintenance, and reuse.
Managing datasets as single, large units complicates incremental updates, obscures dependencies, inhibits flexible reuse or remixing of individual components, and can be notably time-consuming.
The lack of granularity often results in inefficient storage and processing, as small changes may necessitate duplicating or regenerating large portions of data.

% And humans, researchers included, **already** modularize their stuff - They use folders!
% But they often lack guidance on such folders organization and logistics to facilitate efficient project management and collaboration!

Adopting a modular organization, as advocated by YODA, directly addresses these challenges through explicit separation of concerns.
Rather than managing the dataset as one indivisible whole, YODA promotes a compositional approach, structuring projects as assemblies of independently versioned and well-defined components.
Individual parts—such as input and reference datasets, processing scripts, and computational environments—can be updated or replaced independently, thus minimizing disruption and maximizing reusability.

The layout of these components plays a crucial role in enabling effective modularity.
An idiomatic YODA dataset clearly delineates elements into structured directories, such as:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{code/}: containing analysis scripts and tests
  \item \textbf{inputs/}: encapsulating raw or intermediate datasets
  \item \textbf{envs/}: defining computational environments (e.g., Singularity containers)
  \item \textbf{docs/}: for project documentation
  \item \textbf{results/}: explicitly identified outputs (e.g., figures, tables, derived datasets)
\end{itemize}

% The exact organization might vary depending on the field of investigation and existing conventions.
This intentional organization clarifies how components interact and supports domain-specific standards (e.g., BIDS).
It enables researchers to compose and recombine modules flexibly to produce varied outcomes.

% It is crucial to note that in such idiomatic YODA dataset, all necessary components (such as inputs/ and envs/) necessary to produce results MUST be available within this dataset.
% Referencing materials outside of the folder (e.g. from ../ parent folder, or from online docker hub) breaks the containment and makes module, if defined by the folder boundary, either not portable or loosing guarantees for completeness. 
% DO NOT LOOK UP YODA!

Thus, a dataset version can be precisely described as the pairing of generated results with composition of specific module versions, each independently managed.

% A folder by itself is insufficient to be a "module".
% It requires metadata which would at least demarkate module boundary and potentially associate with specific version control mechanisms and distributions.
% In case of use of git VCS, git repository boundary establishes a module which could be independently re-used while retaining unambigous versioning information across such reuses. 

% TODO: formal principles removed — now in STAMPED table (M.1, M.2)

\subsection{Portability}

A research object that is self-contained, tracked, and modular may still fail to reproduce if it depends on undocumented host environment state---hardcoded paths, implicitly available tools, or specific OS configurations.
Portability requires that procedures can be executed on different host environments, given documented system requirements.

Research reproducibility fundamentally depends not only on preserving code and data, but also on capturing the complete computational environment—the operating system, libraries, dependencies, and tool versions—that produced the results.
Environmental drift, where software dependencies evolve or disappear over time, is a primary cause of computational irreproducibility. Even with identical code and data, differences in library versions, compiler settings, or system configurations can produce divergent results or outright failures.

Computational environments should be explicitly defined (not implicitly assumed), machine-reproducible, version controlled alongside code and data, and self-contained within the project boundary.

Two primary approaches exist for environment portability:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Container-based}: Docker, Singularity/Apptainer provide OS-level isolation
  \item \textbf{Package-based}: Nix, Guix provide declarative, reproducible package management
\end{enumerate}

STAMPED is environment-mechanism-agnostic; what matters is that
environments are explicitly specified, versioned, and available within the project.

% TODO: spectrum — minimum (documented system requirements, no hardcoded paths) vs ideal (machine-reproducible environment specs, containers)
% TODO: the code/ vs code/local/ pattern for non-portable config — see #34
% TODO: randomness/seeds as a portability concern — see #34
% TODO: provenance format targets (W3C PROV, BEP028, RO-Crate, BioComputeObject) — where do these go? Discussion?

\section{Discussion}

\subsection{Comparison to Related Approaches}

\subsubsection{DVC (Data Version Control)}
Shares ``Git for data'' philosophy but differs in architecture:
DVC uses external .dvc files with remote storage configuration, while YODA with git-annex integrates directly into the git repository structure.
DVC focuses on Python and ML workflows within a single project, whereas YODA is language-agnostic and supports federated multi-project composition.
Both are valid; choice depends on team familiarity (DVC easier for ML engineers), infrastructure (DVC integrates easily with cloud ML platforms), and scale requirements (git-annex more flexible for federated datasets).

\subsubsection{Pachyderm}
Enterprise ``Git for data'' with Kubernetes-native architecture.
Pachyderm requires a centralized cluster and cloud infrastructure, while YODA is local-first, works offline, and supports federation.
Pachyderm provides automatic pipeline triggering, whereas YODA uses explicit execution (e.g., \texttt{datalad run}).
Pachyderm excels for production ML pipelines, team collaboration with shared compute resources, and automatic scaling.
YODA excels for research workflows, offline work, and heterogeneous datasets across institutions.

\subsubsection{Kedro}
Python data engineering framework with modular pipelines.
Kedro provides within-project modularity through Python pipeline components, while YODA provides across-project modularity through subdatasets as git submodules.
Kedro includes built-in visualization (Kedro-Viz), whereas YODA is CLI-focused with integration to external tools.
These approaches are complementary: a Kedro pipeline inside a YODA dataset combines both strengths.

\subsubsection{Cloud Platforms (Code Ocean, brainlife.io, Flywheel)}
Turnkey reproducibility services with proprietary interfaces.
Platforms offer zero local setup and institutional partnerships; YODA offers local control with no vendor lock-in.
Platforms provide web GUIs with point-and-click interaction; YODA provides CLI/API with scriptable automation.
Platforms are centralized (single capsule or project); YODA is federated (compose across repositories).
YODA principles could wrap platform outputs: download results, organize locally with full versioning, and compose across platforms via subdatasets.

\subsection{Trade-offs and Limitations}

\subsubsection{git-annex Complexity vs Git LFS Simplicity}
YODA uses git-annex for maximum flexibility, supporting many remote types including SSH, S3, HTTP, local drives, and even offline USB drives.
This comes at a cost: a steeper learning curve.
Git LFS offers a simpler alternative that is transparent to users and has native GitHub/GitLab support with broad adoption.
The trade-off: Git LFS is centralized (requires an LFS server), lacks offline capability, and has less flexible remote configurations.
``YODA-lite'' implementations using Git LFS are feasible for easier onboarding, sacrificing federation flexibility.

\subsubsection{When YODA Is vs Is Not Appropriate}

\textbf{YODA excels when}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Multi-institutional collaboration requires federated datasets
    \item Long-term reproducibility spans decades or requires offline archives
    \item Heterogeneous workflows are not tied to a specific platform
    \item Data sovereignty requirements preclude mandatory cloud upload
    \item Complex dependency graphs involve subdatasets from diverse sources
\end{itemize}

\textbf{YODA may be more than needed for}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Single-script analyses where version control alone suffices
    \item Ephemeral exploratory work such as Jupyter notebooks
    \item Cloud-native ML production where Pachyderm or a platform may be a better fit
    \item Small teams with simple workflows where DVC or Git LFS may suffice
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration Opportunities}

YODA principles are complementary, not competitive, with existing standards:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{YODA + BIDS}: Domain standard within YODA structure
    \item \textbf{YODA + RO-Crate}: Organization during research, packaging for publication
    \item \textbf{YODA + FAIR}: Structure projects, then share via FAIR
    \item \textbf{YODA + workflow systems}: Organize, then execute (Nextflow, Snakemake, CWL)
    \item \textbf{YODA + platforms}: Download, version, and compose locally
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Future Directions}

\subsubsection{Provenance Standards Convergence}
Ongoing work toward unified provenance representation, including BEP028 and RO-Crate convergence, will improve YODA interoperability with domain-specific tools.

\subsubsection{Tool Certification}
Formal YODA principles enable ``YODA-compliant'' tool certification, similar to BIDS validation.

\subsubsection{Teaching Materials}
Operationalized principles provide a foundation for structured curriculum development beyond current tutorial-based approaches.

\subsubsection{Existing YODA Adoption}
Several research projects have already adopted and documented YODA principles, demonstrating practical utility across domains.

\textbf{BIDS Standard Evolution}: A significant validation of the ``do not look up'' principle occurred within the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) community.
Originally, the BIDS specification nested derived data under \texttt{derivatives/} within the original raw dataset, creating upward dependencies that violated portability.
Following YODA principles, the BIDS community reversed this relationship: derivative datasets now exist independently and reference raw data as subdatasets, not vice versa.

This architectural shift influenced major neuroimaging tools:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{fMRIPrep}: Switched default output layout to follow YODA structure
    % TODO: add GitHub issue reference for "yoda" layout proposal
    \item \textbf{OpenNeuroDerivatives}: Entire derivative dataset collection now follows YODA organization, separating processed outputs from raw data dependencies
    \item \textbf{BIDS specification}: Updated to accommodate and recommend YODA-compliant layouts for derivative datasets
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Workflow Platforms}: Infrastructure projects implementing YODA at scale:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BABS}: Platform implementing the ``FAIRly big workflow'' approach, demonstrating YODA principles for large-scale neuroimaging analyses with containerized pipelines and modular dataset composition
    \item \textbf{CRCNS.org}: Neuroscience data sharing platform providing YODA-structured templates and validation tools
\end{itemize}

These adoptions demonstrate that YODA principles solve practical organizational challenges across scales, from individual studies to community-wide infrastructure.
