\section{Introduction}

Managing data presents unprecedented challenges in modern science due to rapidly expanding dataset scale, complexity, and interdependency.
Currently it remains common practice to maintain data, code, provenance, and computational environments separately-- often lacking sufficient reproducibility, transparency, and therefore rigor.

Version control of research objects is increasingly adopted, particularly for code and containers, yet data versioning remains frequently disregarded [cite DataLad paper?].
We assert that a composed representation of explicitly versioned data, code, software environments, and provenance within a single reproducible structure has significants benefits.
YODA attempts to provide a simple set of idioms that lead to the development of such a dataset structure.

% Composition remains "an issue"
% Often relates to "provenance"
% **Introduce existing compositional patterns (references/urls), frictionless data, BIDS (bids uri, SourceDatasets, code/), other approaches to describe; Actionability: PROV ** 
% Introduce YODA (and VAMP) as attempt to formalize principles on HOW components should be organized using version control system

% Special accent should be pointed to "pragmatism" -- there could be "migrations" between pragmatic and "standardized" (e.g. DataLad run records -> PROV)

\section{Results}

% ... pillars ...


Yarik feels that we have

- Composition
 - self containment
 - compute environments 
- Version control
- Actionability (PROV)
