\section{Immediate TODOs}

- do research on related compositional patterns across standards and fields
- 

\section{Abstract}

% TODO: compose later when other stuff filled out

\section{Introduction}

% Yarik: start with description of the field and problem statement,  general notion of all sciences becoming increasingly empirical. Data is integral part. But people manage code, containers and data all separate without necessarily having consolidated represenation allowing to re-gather/establish all involved components . Versioning of data is usually disregarded...
% Then briefly introduce version control for data, state that versioning usually present for containers and even more often code 
% Composition remains "an issue"
% Often relates to "provenance"
% **Introduce existing compositional patterns (references/urls), frictionless data, BIDS (bids uri, SourceDatasets, code/), other approaches to describe; Actionability: PROV ** 
% Introduce YODA (and VAMP) as attempt to formalize principles on HOW components should be organized using version control system

% Special accent should be pointed to "pragmatism" -- there could be "migrations" between pragmatic and "standardized" (e.g. DataLad run records -> PROV)

\section{Results}

% ... pillars ...


Yarik feels that we have

- Composition
 - self containment
 - compute environments 
- Version control
- Actionability (PROV)
