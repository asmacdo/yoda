# STAMPED properties for reproducible research objects

> Must follow requirements in [SDATA-ARTICLE-REQUIREMENTS.md](research/SDATA-ARTICLE-REQUIREMENTS.md)

## Abstract


## Introduction

- Challenge: dataset scale, complexity, interdependency
- Workflows as formal specifications (code, config, data, provenance)
  - Table 1: Term definitions
- Components managed separately undermines reproducibility
- FAIR / FAIR4RS / WCI-FW foundation, inspiration, and differences
- YODA as pragmatic best practices for FAIR-aligned research objects

## Comments

- Table 2 (all principles)

### Section for each property 

details for each property

End with table of normative properties (imperative requirements stated in each section)

### Checklist for compliance to principles

- to apply to the examples in next section
- ordered by importance accord to RFC from previous declarations

### Enabling tools

- Integration Opportunities (how to leverage toools to make STAMPED easier to implement)
  - YODA + BIDS, RO-Crate, FAIR, workflow systems, platforms
- Tools before examples to provide more context/understanding
- Increases interoperability among tools
- git-annex complexity vs Git LFS simplicity

### Examples and Case Studies

Point to our living documentation, minimal examples/counter-examples
- fairly big workflow, AIND, non-neuroscience???

### Lit Review

- Comparison to Related Approaches
  - DVC: shared philosophy, different architecture
  - Pachyderm: centralized/cloud vs local-first/federated
  - Kedro: within-project vs across-project modularity (complementary)
  - Cloud Platforms: turnkey vs local control, YODA can wrap platform outputs

### Future Directions
- Provenance standards convergence (better standards for prov)
- Tool certification
- Teaching materials
