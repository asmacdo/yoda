This doesn't mean all bytes must be stored inline, but that all dependencies are tracked and mirrorable.\n\n## MUST be contained\n- Raw and derived datasets\n- Analysis code and scripts\n- Built environment artifacts (e.g., container images)\n- Configuration and parameter files\n- Provenance records\n\n## MAY be contained\n- Upstream build dependencies (e.g., the `ubuntu:22.04` base image referenced by `FROM` in a Dockerfile)\n- Source packages used to build a contained derivative\n- Build toolchains\n\nThe rationale: we include **derivatives** (the built container), so the upstream sources used to produce them are not essential for reproducing results from that point forward.\n\n## The Pulp analogy\n\n[Pulp](https://pulpproject.org/) is a content management platform that mirrors entire upstream package repositories (RPM, PyPI, container registries, etc.), creating point-in-time snapshots of everything down to the base OS packages. This represents the extreme end of the self-containment spectrum — full supply chain mirroring. While achievable and valuable in enterprise/infrastructure contexts, VAMP does not require this level of containment for research reproducibility. The line is drawn at the derivatives: if you have the built container image version-controlled in your research object, you don't also need to mirror the Ubuntu APT repository it was built from.\n\nPulp illustrates that the containment spectrum is continuous, and VAMP's MUST/MAY distinction is a pragmatic cut point — not an inherent boundary.","files":null}]}
